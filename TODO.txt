Objects
-------
[ ] Place lights
[ ] Render light boundaries (position spheres; direction rays/cones)
[ ] Better translation / object placement
[ ] Snap to grid
[ ] Snap to object (per-object type, relative "snap points")
[ ] Directly edit properties (textbox)
[ ] Set texture
[ ] Set mesh
[-] Rotate around arbitrary point

========================================
// Engine
========================================

Animation
---------
[ ] Global translate, rotate
[ ] Change texture (instant, fade?)
[ ] Change mesh
[ ] Change type-specific "properties" (e.g. toggle light on/off)
[-] Global scale?
[n] Deform mesh

Collision
---------
[ ] Ray
[ ] OBB
[ ] Sphere
[-] Ellipsoid
[-] Scene graph (kd-tree, BSP?)
[-] Frustum culling
[-] BVH
[-] Mesh

Foliage
-------
[ ] Billboard ground foliage (e.g. 2-plane grass) normal should point straight
    up for proper lighting calculations. /watch?v=BJDQNjlEO0I

Input
-----
[ ] FPS camera? How to lock pitch / yaw with quaternions? Store current pitch /
    yaw values and convert to quat whenever they change?
[ ] Better mouse smoothing / accuracy?
    "The Witness needs Raw Input to get good low-level relative mouse movements"

Lighting
--------
[ ] Light objects (OBJ_LIGHT)
[ ] Multiple lights (how to differentiate types in shader?)
[ ] Shadows

Shaders
-------
[ ] Refactor program_bind() / program_uniform_set() out of object_render()
